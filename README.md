# Programming-Languages

•Induction and recursion: Implement recursive programs in a functional language to manipulate data structures such as lists and trees. Explain the relationship between inductively  defined data types, recursive programs that process inputs of those data types, and inductive arguments about the correctness of those programs using induction over data types.

•Trees and abstract syntax: Model a labeled tree data structure, such as an abstract syntax tree, using algebraic datatypes. Implement a recursiveprogram such as an interpreter,  pretty-printer, parser, and typechecker for functional, imperative or object-oriented languages.

•Scoping: Implement static and dynamic scoping rules in programming languages, and use environments and closures to realize these scoping rules, where appropriate.

•Parameter passing: Implement parameter-passing mechanisms such as call-by-value, call-by-result, call-by-value-result, call-by-reference, call-by-nameand call-by-need (lazy  evaluation); able to reason about the behavior of programs that use those mechanisms.

•Type systems: Define and implement type systems as inductive definitions, and reason about well-typedness of programs using those type systems.
